*Your Tasks
Create a new Github repository with a README and a single python file.

Make your Python script accept an argument to traverse any path (don't hardcode the path!)

Use different options in the script for reporting, like:

No more than 20 files

Files larger  than a specific size in megabytes

Complete the Demo project in GitHub with a README.md that describes what you did.

Create a Demo Video and reference it in your GitHub Project.

*Bonus
Try adding options to your script like a help menu, or matching specific names or suffixes. For example finding files that end in .mp3
